    "Overall I would choose the tuned AdaBoost model (with parameters listed above) due to it having the highest sensitivity (recall score). This model would be used essentially as a screening tool for real diagnostic testing. Having healthy patients go through testing and finding out they have a negative diagnosis is preferable to patients with the condition being innaccurately non-diagnosed.\n",
